Actually I think steam has the same idea I'm having right now, I bet they created CS and thought eh we could do something very similar but different, they probably reused their system for CS and changed some qualities and items, but the same system.

Examples: Dota2, team fortress 2, cs, they all seem to be based on the same system.

Plans for this project:
The original code came from: https://github.com/rannmann/Backpack.tf_Tooltips
This guy is using the backpack.tf api to get pricing on items for team fortress 2. We could use something very similar but targeted at the cs:go market.

We could almost keep the front end and just change some of the if statements for qualities and types, but could keep a lot of the logic.

Just change the backend slightly to target cs:go data instead :)

I would also like to set up some reports on history data, and not just live. I want to see some trending, deals that I wouldn't want to pass up, and send me email notifications about items hitting a certain threshold. We could include the 15% margin to valve as part of the reporting.
